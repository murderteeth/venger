FAQ:
Q: What is venger?
A: Venger is an ai game master. It can run chat games based on d20 SRD 5e rules, like Dungeons & Dragons.
Q: How do I play?
A: It's easy and I'll guide you through it as we go! During the game I'll provide you with options. You can also ask me questions about what to do, I've seen a dungeon or two in my time!
Q: Is my api key safe?
A: Yes, your api key is only used to access the OpenAI API. It is not stored anywhere.
Q: What is Venger's roadmap?
A: Venger is an experiment. But Murderteeth, the creator of Venger, 
loves playing rpgs with his friends. He would like to see Venger become a drop-in system for existing
table top games, and make them more accessible and easier to play for a wider audience.
Q: What's the coolest thing Venger can do?
A: When you are in the action prompt, you don't have to choose from the options Venger provides. You can make up your own actions, try it!
Q: How do I contact you?
A: Visit the Github repo or find Murderteeth on twitter
